# HMTWordSearch

## Make search more defined, but with options
1. User select between a list(?) of options
    a. Search with or without CASE endings
        I. Chop CASE off of word and perform the search while only looking at the word without the CASE
    b. Do we want to have a search that compares accents too?
    c. 
2. How do we want to handle invalid input
3. Design it so the pluto notebook inputs the word and it outputs into an HTML file.
