# HMTWordSearch

## Make search more defined, but with options
1. User select between a list(?) of options
    a. Search with or without CASE endings
        I. Chop CASE off of word and perform the search while only looking at the word without the CASE
    b. Do we want to have a search that compares accents too?
    c. Titles/Lemma/Commentary
2. How do we want to handle invalid input
3. Design it so the pluto notebook inputs the word and it outputs into an HTML file.

- added a function to check the similarity between words given a threshold percentage.
- started creating functions to strengthen our search and give the user more of an opportunity to refine the search.

- Added Genie functionality to my Mac, as of right now I'm not sure I'll be able to connect it to the GitHub, I'm sure there's a way, we may have to create a new repo in order to put the new files in there. 
- Created Framework.html - it's the basics of the search bar, we'll want to potentially add colors, change fonts, what have you.
- Because of Genie, I have the files that will implement the code into HTML, we can keep working on it in the repo and I'll copy/paste it over to the Genie files. When we meet again I'll show you everything and we'll figure out how to setup the GitHub so you can access the files as well.
- We can still go with the user checking boxes to decide the search, or we can do every search and add a filter box and the user can decide what they want to see.
